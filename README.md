## 🎛️ Filter & Search Controls

The app provides intuitive filter and search controls to help you view tasks by their status or quickly find tasks:

- **All**: Shows every task.
- **Pending**: Shows only tasks that are not completed.
- **Completed**: Shows only tasks that are marked as completed.
- **Search**: Instantly filter tasks by typing in the search box.

You can switch between these filters using the buttons at the top of the task list. The active filter is highlighted for clarity.

## 🗑️ Global Delete Confirmation

When you press the delete button on any task, a modern confirmation dialog appears **centered between the form and the task list**, overlaying the dashboard. This ensures you never accidentally delete a task and provides a professional, user-friendly experience.
